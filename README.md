Project Name: Stay Fourever Young
This project is an interactive, responsive website dedicated to showcasing DAY6, a Korean music band. The site highlights their merchandise, tour dates, history, event booking options, and social media accounts. Its primary goal is to give fans and visitors a comprehensive look into the band's journey, from their beginnings to their current achievements, while offering features like merchandise browsing and tour date details.

The website features intuitive navigation, visually captivating merchandise galleries with hover animations, and a full history section that celebrates the band’s evolution. Key highlights include responsive layouts for seamless access across devices, engaging micro-interactions to boost user engagement, and filtering options to simplify browsing. By blending sleek design with user-friendly functionality, the project delivers an enjoyable, immersive experience that aligns with DAY6's unique branding and identity.

The main goals are:
For fans: Create a central hub where they can remain up to current on tour dates, purchase special goods, and learn about the band's history and journey.
